Hello.
For Opening the project you can just clone it to your github account and open it in cloud 9.
Unfortanetly, i can not help you currently with openning it in the ruby on rails standalone scince i do not
use that.Until then there are plenty of tutorials.And This Project is OpenSource for your use as long as the word TheGroup
is not located in your project.

Hope you enjoy :)


Best Regards,
